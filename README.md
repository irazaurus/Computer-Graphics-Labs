# Introduction to 3D Game Programming with DirectX 12 source code

## Introduction

This is a fork of an unofficial fork of the [sample code repo]((https://github.com/d3dcoder/d3d12book)) for [Frank D. Luna's](http://www.d3dcoder.net/default.htm) book [Introduction to 3D Game Programming with DirectX 12](http://www.d3dcoder.net/d3d12.htm). The code remains the copyright of Frank D. Luna, it is just merged into one big project with techniques from several chapters.

## Building

You'll need Visual Studio 2022 with the _Desktop development with C++_ and _Game development with C++_ Visual Studio workloads. Once you've satisfied these requirements, you should be able to open any of the included SLN files, build, and run the sample apps. Obviously, you also need to have a GPU that supports DirectX 12 for the samples to work correctly.

## Changes

I left only one project based off the Chapter 9: Texturing, which also includes first person camera, assimp model loading, tesselation, post-effects and shadow maps [more to come in the future]. The project is for educational purposes only.
